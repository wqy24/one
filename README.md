# 1 the programming languange

One is a programming language. The programs are written to `.1` file.

Each .1 file contains 1 one value.

## Values
- Numbers: `12.3`
- Strings: ``` `Hold it!` ```
- Comments: `; Objection!`
- Functions: `param: add 1 param`
- Function calls: `abs -124` or `-124 | abs`(Pipe)
- Array: `[2, 4, 8]`
- Pair: ```<37 & `Take That!`> ```
- Lisp-like list: ```<37, `Take That`>```
- Improper list: ```<27, 37 & `Take That`>```
- Value in parens: `(abs -990)`
- None (matches all types): `()`
- References: `{array/reduce}`

# Attention!
One is static typed. But all types will be auto-detected.
Here are types.
## Base
- Numbrs
- Strings
## Composed
- Functions: param, result
- Pairs: car, cdr (Wow, it's lisp!)
